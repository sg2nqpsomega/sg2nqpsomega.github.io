        <h2>What is cryptocurrency?</h2>
        <h3>What is money? It’s a piece of paper for all intents and purposes, tear it apart and it loses all its worth. 
Money replaced barter system simply because so many more services were available that transactions weren’t unilateral. If you made shoes and a barber needed them, but you just got a haircut, he would have nothing to offer. So instead they came out with coins made of materials that were hard to find and held a worth, which was universally decided. This way, the barber would give you the coin, and you could use that coin to buy food. This got more formal and turned into the bank systems that we have now.
<br><br>
Cryptocurrency is virtual money - Money that you can use to buy and sell things, pay for services, and make any transactions. Every transaction is kept track of in a ledger, which is openly visible. 
</h3><hr>
        <h2>Why is it better than real money?</h2>
        <h3>Money, as you know it, is controlled by banks, and physical cash isn’t kept track of whatsoever. If 20 people buy second hand products for 100$ cash from someone, that person will have 2000$, which seems like a good amount of money for an assassin or for drugs. Who knows what he spends it on? 
        <br><br>With cryptocurrency, all money laundering is cut off if you mandate identification for accounts (since every transaction is recorded in an online ledger).</h3><hr>
        <h2>What is mining and who benefits from helping mine “coins”</h2>
        <h3>In physical world, you mine metals. The metals have their worth because they’re considered precious and they can be sold off. It takes money to mine the metals, but there is a profit when you sell it.<br><br>
In the virtual world, mining is done on servers. Similar to physical, it takes money to run servers, but in return you get to keep some amount of the currency.
</h3><hr>
        <h2>Why not just keep the system we have now?</h2>
        <h3>The current system is prone to falling apart, since it is supported by untrusted reserves. A bank can declare bankruptcy when it chooses too and everything you had in their is gone.<br><br>
Money laundering is another major opponent to the current system.
The fees you have to pay to the bank every time you make a transaction help run banks. The system helps make money for the bankers and you lose money just to support people who print notes.</h3>
